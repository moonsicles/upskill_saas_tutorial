* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app 
should validate the fields. Rails app will note if plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to
stripe server and stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
